# ETF-Tracking-Error-Research-Project
The attached "README (project).txt" file outlines the steps followed in the research project. The analysis is performed partly in MATLAB and party in STATA. The underlying dataset, the MATLAB code, the STATA code, and my research paper are all attached.  

My research paper concludes that ETF's benchmark market structure (emerging or developed) and geographic region (Europe, Asia or Americas) have additional explanatory power for ETFâ€™s tracking errors when controlling for the variables: expense ratio, ETF trade volume, bid-ask spread, dividend yield, and changes in the exchange rate.

I completed this project as part of the Credential in Quantative Financial Economics (QFE) program at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2017.
