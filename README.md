# ETF-Tracking-Error-Research-Project
This repository includes a research paper, and underlying analysis and datasets, analyzing the effect of ETF’s benchmark’s market structure and geographic region on tracking errors. 

I find that ETF's benchmark market structure (emerging or developed) and geographic region (Europe, Asia or Americas) have additional explanatory power for ETF’s tracking errors when controlling for the variables: expense ratio, ETF trade volume, bid-ask spread, dividend yield, and changes in the exchange rate.

I completed this project as part of the Credential in Quantative Financial Economics (QFE) program at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2017. 

More information about the program is available at: qfe.web.unc.edu. 

The attached README (project) file outlines the steps followed in the research project. The analysis is performed partly in MATLAB and party in STATA. The underlying datasets, the MATLAB code, the STATA code, and my research paper are all attached.
